    <title>Set environment variables using the OpenStack RC
        file</title>
    <para>To set the required environment variables for the OpenStack
        command-line clients, you must create an environment file
        called an OpenStack rc file, or <filename>openrc.sh</filename>
            file.<phrase audience="enduser"> If your OpenStack
            installation provides it, you can download the file from
            the OpenStack dashboard as an administrative user or any
            other user.</phrase> This project-specific environment
        file contains the credentials that all OpenStack services
        use.</para>
    <para>When you source the file, environment variables are set for
        your current shell. The variables enable the OpenStack client
        commands to communicate with the OpenStack services that run
        in the cloud.</para>
    <note>
        <para>Defining environment variables using an environment file is not a
        common practice on Microsoft Windows. Environment variables are usually
        defined in the <guilabel>Advanced</guilabel> tab of the System
        Properties dialog box.</para>
