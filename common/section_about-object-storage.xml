    <title>Object存储介绍</title>
    <para>Object Storage is a robust, highly scalable and
          fault tolerant storage platform for unstructured data
          such as objects. Objects are stored bits, accessed
          through a RESTful, HTTP-based interface. You cannot access
          data at the block or file level. Object Storage is commonly
          used to archive and back up data, with use cases in
          virtual machine image, photo, video and music storage.</para>
    <para>Object Storage provides a high degree of availability, throughput,
          and performance with its scale out architecture. Each object is
          replicated across multiple servers, residing within the
          same data center or across data centers, which mitigates the risk
          of network and hardware failure. In the event of hardware failure,
          Object Storage will automatically copy objects to a new location
          to ensure that there are always three copies available.
          Object Storage is an eventually consistent distributed storage
          platform; it sacrifices consistency for maximum
          availability and partition tolerance. Object Storage enables you to
          create a reliable platform by using commodity hardware and
          inexpensive storage.</para>
