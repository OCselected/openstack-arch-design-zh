      <para>The Identity Service provides
        identity, token, catalog, and policy services.
         It consists of:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><systemitem class="service">keystone-all</systemitem>.
            Starts both the service and administrative APIs in a
            single process to provide Catalog, Authorization, and
            Authentication services for OpenStack.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Identity Service functions. Each has a pluggable back
            end that allows different ways to use the particular
            service. Most support standard back ends like LDAP or
            SQL.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
        <para>The Identity Service also maintains a user that
            corresponds to each service, such as, a user named
                <emphasis>nova</emphasis> for the Compute service, and
            a special service tenant called
                <emphasis>service</emphasis>.</para>
