        <td>
    A prefix used by hash_path to offer a bit more security when generating hashes for
    paths. It simply appends this value to all paths; if someone knows this suffix,
    it's easier for them to guess the hash a path will end up with.
    New installations are advised to set this parameter to a random secret,
    which would not be disclosed ouside the organization.
    The same secret needs to be used by all swift servers of the same cluster.

    Existing installations should set this parameter to an empty string.</td>
